# Fluent UI

Bring Microsoft's Fluent Design System to Windows Presentation Foundation.

# Getting Started

Consider Fluent UI to be in serious alpha state right now. It is missing a lot of default inbuilt Control Styles as well planned custom Controls which can be found in UWP and Win UI.

Default Control Styles

- [x] Button
- [ ] TextBox
- [ ] PasswordBox
- [x] ChecBox
- [ ] RadioButton
- [ ] TabControl
- [x] ListBox
- [x] ListBoxItem
